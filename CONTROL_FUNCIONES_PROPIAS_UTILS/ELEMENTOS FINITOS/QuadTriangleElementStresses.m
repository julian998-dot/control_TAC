%QuadTriangleElementStresses   This function returns the element 
%                              stresses for a quadratic   
%                              triangular element with modulus of 
%                              elasticity E, Poisson's ratio NU,  
%                              thickness t, coordinates of the 
%                              node 1 (x1,y1), coordinates of 
%                              node 2 (x2,y2),  
%                              coordinates of node 3 
%                              (x3,y3), and element displacement
%                              vector u. Use p = 1 for cases of 
%                              plane stress, and p = 2 for cases 
%                              of plane strain.
%                              The size of the element stiffness 
%                              matrix is 12 x 12.
